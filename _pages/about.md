## Bio

I am a **Computational Scientist** with a background in **Applied Mathematics** and **Aerospace Engineering**, specializing in **Advanced Aerodynamics and Propulsion**. My work combines computational fluid dynamics (CFD), numerical modeling, high-fidelity simulations, high-performance computing (HPC), reduced order methods, and machine learning to tackle complex problems in aerospace, metallurgy, and energy sectors.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **Computational Fluid Dynamics**, **Reduced Order Modelling**, and **Scientific Machine Learning**.  

I am particularly interested in **reactive and multiphase flows**, **heat transfer**, **aeroacoustics**, and **aerodynamics**, with applications ranging from academic studies to industrial problems in **aerospace**, **metal industries**, and **energy**, and more recently in **climate physics**.  My work is grounded in the numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs), with experience in discretization methods such as the **Finite Volume**, **Finite Element**, and **Finite Difference** methods. 

I am also focused on **reduced order methods**, including **projection-based** and **data-driven approaches**, as well as **non-linear model reduction techniques** for the construction of efficient and accurate reduced order models, and on exploring **Scientific Machine Learning** to accelerate simulations and enhance predictive modelling.
