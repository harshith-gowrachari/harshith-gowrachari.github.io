## Bio

Ph.D. in [Mathematical Analysis, Modelling and Applications](https://www.math.sissa.it/content/mathematical-analysis-modelling-and-applications-0)  
Thesis: [Towards Real-Time Digital Twins in Steelmaking: The Role of Reduced Order Methods in Continuous Casting Tundish Process](https://iris.sissa.it/handle/20.500.11767/146790)  
Advisor : [Prof. Gianluigi Rozza](http://people.sissa.it/~grozza/)  
Co-Advisor : [Prof. Giovanni Stabile](https://www.giovannistabile.com/)

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **Computational Fluid Dynamics**, **Reduced Order Modelling**, and **Scientific Machine Learning**.  

In particular, my research interests include **multiphase flows**, **heat transfer**, **aeroacoustics**, and **reactive flows** within CFD, with applications ranging from academic studies to industrial problems in **aerospace**, **metal industries**, and **energy**. My work is grounded in the numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs), with experience in discretization methods such as the **Finite Volume** and **Finite Element** methods.

My research interests also include the development of **Reduced Order Methods**, including **projection-based** and **data-driven approaches**, as well as **non-linear model reduction techniques**, and the exploration of **Scientific Machine Learning** to accelerate simulations and enhance predictive modelling.
